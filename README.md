For context, at the time of writing this, we are enrolled in the Data Analytics and Visualizations bootcamp with the University of MN. in this repo, you will find the Resources folder, statis folder, Data cleaning jupyter notebook file, and the index.html file. The Resources folder contains the raw data from FRED. The static folder contains two folders, the css folder containing the "style.css" file and the js folder containing the "logic.js" file.

# Project: "USA Cost of Homes, Mortgage Rates, and Average Household Income in the Past 50 Years"

### Description: 
The aim of this project is to uncover patterns between the cost of homes in the US, their interest rates, and the average household income within the past 50 years.

### Over arching Questions: 

1. What is the relationship between US cost of homes and the interest rates?
2. What is the relationship between US average household income and US cost of homes?
3. What is the % of the avg household income needed to afford the avg mortgage payment?

### Hypotheses:

1. As the interest rates decrease, the cost of a home increases. 
2. As the average household income increases, the cost of homes increases.
3. 28% of the average household income is needed to cover the mortgage payments.
